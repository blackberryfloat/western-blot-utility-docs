# Introduction

The Western Blot Utility is a desktop application for organizing and quantifying Western Blot data. It has a strong focus on privacy, data integrity, and transparency so you can trust, but verify what it is doing with your data. All data stays confidential and local to your machine.

Producing accurate results is very important to us. All data measurements are taken from the raw image without any scaling. All calculations are based on published methods and have an extensive suite of automated test cases to back them. This is coupled with manual verification of the data by beta users. If you find any issues with the integrity of our data, please [file a bug](https://github.com/blackberryfloat/western-blot-utility-docs/issues) immediately.
