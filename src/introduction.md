**Western Blot Utility** is a modern desktop application built to streamline the **organization, quantification, and analysis** of western blot experiments. Designed with a focus on **data integrity, transparency, and privacy**, it empowers researchers to produce consistent, auditable, and reproducible results—**without relying on manual macros or third-party plugins**.

All data remains private and is stored **locally on your machine**—never sent to the cloud—giving you full control over sensitive research data.

## Key Features

> **NOTE** We are about to get an exciting ugrade with v1.0.0 to our automated band detection as we transition to using AI rather than a hueristic algorithm.

- **End-to-End Experiment Management:** Seamlessly group and analyze multiple images within a single experiment, ensuring consistent and reproducible results.
- **Automated Band Detection:** Utilize advanced algorithms to automatically identify and quantify bands, significantly reducing manual intervention and potential errors.
- **Comprehensive Normalization:** Achieve accurate normalization across your dataset, facilitating reliable comparisons and robust data interpretation.
- **Integrated Audit Capabilities:** Maintain full transparency with built-in audit logs, enabling traceability and verification of all analytical steps.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Navigate effortlessly through your data with intuitive controls, including save states, undo/redo functionality, and efficient image navigation.

## Who Is This For?

The Western Blot Utility is ideal for researchers who:

1. **Process large volumes** of western blot images  
2. **Need consistent and automated normalization** of blot data  
3. **Value reproducibility**, transparency, and auditability in their workflow  
4. Are frustrated with fragmented workflows in tools like ImageJ, Image Studio, or Photoshop
5. Want basic usability functionality like undo and redo that are frequently missing in scientific tools

## Accuracy You Can Trust

- All measurements are taken **directly from the raw image**—no compression, no scaling.  
- Calculations are based on **peer-reviewed methods**, tested with a comprehensive suite of **automated and manual validations**.  
- Built in collaboration with a **third-party researchers (Harvard-affiliated)** to ensure independent validation.
- Complete transparency: review our [audit documentation](user_guide/audit.md) for full traceability.
