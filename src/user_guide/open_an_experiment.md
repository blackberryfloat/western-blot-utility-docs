The process for opening an experiment or creating a new one is the same:

1. Open the file menu.
2. Click **Open**.
3. Select a folder containing the images you want to process.

> **NOTE**  
> A file with the `.wbu` extension will be created in the selected folder. This file contains the application state information for that experiment. It is a JSON object, meaning it is human-readable if you want to inspect it. However, it is strongly recommended that you do NOT modify it, as this could cause issues when the application is loaded next time.
