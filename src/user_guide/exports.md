# Exports

This application allows you to export the calculated intensities for your experiment to a CSV file. You can choose from three export methods: summed, average, and normalized.

- **Summed** is recommended if you have no controls.
- **Normalized** is recommended if you have labeled your controls. The normalized value is calculated if you provide any combination of a loading control, internal control, or both.

If no controls are provided, the export will result in an empty CSV file.

1. Open the file menu.
2. Click **Export**.
3. Select the desired export method (e.g., normalized).
4. Choose an output location in the file dialog.
