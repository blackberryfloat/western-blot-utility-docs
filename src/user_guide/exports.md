# Exports

This application allows you to export the calculated intensities for this experiment to a CSV. Currently you can select from summed, average, and normalized. Summed is recommended if you have no controls and normalized is recommended if you labeled your controls. The normalized value will be calculated if you provide any combination of a loading control, internal control, or both. If there are no controls, you will get an empty CSV.
