The Western Blot Utility is a desktop application designed for organizing and quantifying Western Blot data. It emphasizes privacy, data integrity, and transparency, allowing you to trust but verify how your data is handled. All data remains confidential and local to your machine.
If you do one or more of the following, the Western Blot Utility might be for you:

1. process a significant number of Western Blot Images
1. you want a tool to consistently and reliably handle normalization calculations for you

Producing accurate results is our top priority. All data measurements are taken directly from the raw image without any scaling. Calculations are based on published methods and are supported by an extensive suite of automated test cases, along with manual verification by beta users.
