# Audit

As we mentioned before, producing accurate results is very important to us. All data measurements are taken from the raw image without any scaling. All calculations are based on published methods and have an extensive suite of automated test cases to back them. This is coupled with manual verification of the data by beta users. That being said, mistakes can happen so we provided the audit functionality to empower you to double check our work if you so choose.

This feature is a per image CSV export gives a user full transparency into the calculations that are happening for each ROI behind the scenes. It gives users complete access to the raw values so they can reproduce the calculations by hand.
