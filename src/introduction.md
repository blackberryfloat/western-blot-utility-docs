# Introduction

The Western Blot Utility is a desktop application designed for organizing and quantifying Western Blot data. It emphasizes privacy, data integrity, and transparency, allowing you to trust but verify how your data is handled. All data remains confidential and local to your machine. An internet connection is only used to verify your license, which occurs when opening the application or once a day if left open.

Producing accurate results is our top priority. All data measurements are taken directly from the raw image without any scaling. Calculations are based on published methods and are supported by an extensive suite of automated test cases, along with manual verification by beta users. If you encounter any issues with the integrity of our data, please [file a bug](https://github.com/blackberryfloat/western-blot-utility-docs/issues) immediately.

The Western Blot Utility is in its early stages, which comes with both advantages and challenges. One major advantage is that you have the opportunity to shape the future direction of this product. We are building this tool for you, so your feedback is invaluable in helping us prioritize features that matter most. However, as a small, unfunded project, we have limited resources. While we strive to deliver a stable and polished application, occasional usability issues may arise. Rest assured, we will never compromise the accuracy of our data processing methods. If you appreciate our work and want to support us, we would greatly value your sponsorship.
