# Opening an Experiment

The process for opening an Experiment or creating a new one is the same.

1. open the file menu
1. click open
1. select a folder containing the images you want to process

> **NOTE**
> A file with the .wbu extension will be created in said folder. This file contains the application state information for that experiment. It is a JSON object meaning it is human readable if you want to inspect it. It is strongly encouraged you do NOT modify it though as this could result in issues for the application next time it is loaded.
