# Installation

The Western Blot Utility is a licensed desktop application. We have prebuilt tested binaries for x86_64 architectures running Windows or Linux operating systems that you can download below. If you need a custom build, reach out to [blackberryfloat+wbu@gmail.com](mailto:blackberryfloat+wbu@gmail.com).

## Licensing

While the Western Blot Utility is a licensed application, licenses are FREE. For all licensing requests, please reach out to [blackberryfloat+wbu@gmail.com](mailto:blackberryfloat+wbu@gmail.com). Please use the email address you want the license associated with when reaching out. Currently, we only allow one device per user, with exceptions being handled on a case-by-case basis.

> **NOTE** To be transparent, we need to fund development so we can best support you. Thus, our goal is to always give you the option of either a free version with minimal Ads or a paid license. To support this we must reach a critical mass of users so that advertisers are interested in this platform. The free licenses are the best way to track this information.
