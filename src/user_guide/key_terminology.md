| Experiment               | A project that investigates the effects of various compounds and doses on substances to assess the viability of a compound for drug use. In this application, an experiment is represented by a folder on the file system, typically containing images. |
| Image                    | A digital scan of an optimally exposed blot stained with a specific antibody.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Lane                     | Represents a single case containing a unique set of independent variables, such as drug type, dose, and time factor.                                                                                                                                    |
| Region of Interest (ROI) | A specific rectangular area of pixels within an image and lane that represents the effectiveness of a case. Intensity calculations are performed based on this region.                                                                                  |
