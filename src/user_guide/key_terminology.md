| Experiment               | A project that explores the impact of a combination of compounds and doses on substances in order to gain insight into the viability of a compound for drug use. For this application, an experiment is represented by a folder on the file system. Typically this is a folder of images. |
| Image                    | An image is the digital scan of an optimal exposure capture of a blot stained with a specific antibody.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Lane                     | This represents a singular case that contains unique set of independent variable such as a drug type, dose, and time factor.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Region of Interest (ROI) | The specific rectangle of pixels within an image and lane that represents the effectiveness of a case. Intensity calculations are made based on this item.                                                                                                                                |
